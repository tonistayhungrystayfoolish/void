**Aston** is not just another code editor.  
Itâ€™s a complete reimagining of how developers interact with AI, their codebase, and their creative flow. Built to outperform Claude Code, Cursor, and anything else in the race â€” Aston is your intelligent coding co-pilot, checkpoint system, and local AI powerhouse â€” all in one sleek, lightning-fast interface.

This repository contains the full source code for **Aston**. If you're here, you're early. And we like that.
